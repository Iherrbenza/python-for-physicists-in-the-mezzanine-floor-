Software needed for this intro

First of all, you want to install the python programming language. Also, I recommend JupyterLab as a convenient notebook interface for python programming.

Depending on your taste and your system, you might want to download these individually or as part of a full distribution like Anaconda. The full distro: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual

Miniconda is a minimal istallation of python envioroment, you will need to install the libraries you need. https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html

Jupyter lab o jupyter notebook https://jupyter.org/install.html https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html

An alternative, completely online solution is the Colaboratory platform by Google.
https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb?utm_source=scs-index#recent=true This is a web-based jupyter notebook interface to python and allows you to run your code for free on their GPU servers.

A third alternative is deepnote. This is also a free online platform with a jupyter interface. https://deepnote.com/dashboard
